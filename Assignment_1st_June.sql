-- What is RDBMS? Explain in detail.
-- RDBMS:- Relational Database Management System is a type of DBMS that stores data in the form of related tables(in the form of rows and columns) 
-- (also called relations), allowing for easy organization, retrieval, and manipulation of data using SQL. 
-- RDBMS = Database + Tables + Relationships + SQL
-- Itâ€™s the backbone of most business applications, websites, and data systems we interact with today.
 -- It allows structured storage, retrieval, and management of large sets of related data efficiently.


-- What is normalization? Explain in detail with example.
-- Normalization is the process of organizing data in a relational database to reduce redundancy (duplicate data)
-- and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining 
-- relationships between them using foreign keys.

-- example:- StudentID	Name	Courses	        Instructor
--           1	        Alice	Math, Science	Smith, Johnson
--           2	        Bob	    Math	        Smith
-- Problems:- Multiple values in Courses and Instructor columns.
-- Student Table:
-- StudentID	Name
-- 1            Alice
-- 2	        Bob

-- CourseEnrollment Table:
-- StudentID	Course
-- 1	        Math
-- 1         	Science
-- 2	        Math
