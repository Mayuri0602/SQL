Ques.1    What is Data modelling ? What is E-R modeling ?

Ans.    Process of creating a visual representation or structure of data and its relationships within a system or database, also helps us define how
            data is stored, connected and accessed.
    
Types of data models - Conceptual, Logical and Physical

E-R model is a high-level conceptual data model used to design and represent the structure of a database visually. 




Ques.2   What is DBMS and explain its features over file system.

Ans.   It is a software that allows users to define, create, maintain and control access to databases. It provides an organized way to store, retrieve and manage data efficiently.


File System -                                                                                                                      DBMS-

A way to store and organize files on storage devices.                                                  Software to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.
Stores data as individual files.                                                                                         Stores data in structured formats (tables, schemas).
same data may be stored in multiple files.                                                                     normalization helps reduce redundancy.
Manual, through file-handling code.                                                                                Query-based using languages like SQL.
Difficult to enforce consistently.                                                                                       Constraints and relationships help maintain integrity.
Access usually managed by OS.											     Advanced security features (user roles, permissions).	
Manual and complex.													     Automated backup and recovery options.
Hard to manage simultaneous access.                                                                           Built-in support for multi-user access.
custom code required.                                                                                                       Powerful querying through SQL or APIs.
Becomes inefficient as data grows.                                                                                 Designed to handle large-scale data efficiently.
Difficult to model complex relationships.                                                                        Easily manages relationships via foreign keys.  




Ques.3   Types of DBMS and explain each one of them.

Ans.     Hierarchical DBMS - Data organized in a tree-like structure (parent-child). Rigid structure; difficult to modify.
           
     Network DBMS - More flexible; allows many - to - many relationships using a graph structure, more flexible than hierarchical, and complex to design and maintain.

   Relational DBMS - Data is stored in tables with rows and columns, e.g. MySQL, easy to use.

  Object-Oriented DBMS - Stores data as objects, like in OOP, less widely used, complex queries.
